DuckDuckGo Safari Setup
=======================

This app will replace the Yahoo search in your Safari browser with DuckDuckGo. Your administrator password will be required.
    
If you change your mind, simply open this app again to uninstall.

For wizards only: This is just going to add an entry to your
/etc/hosts file. You can do it yourself if you'd prefer:
